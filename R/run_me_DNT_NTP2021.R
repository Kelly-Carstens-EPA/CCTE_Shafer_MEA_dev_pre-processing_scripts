# The 2 assay controls (BPA and Acetaminophen) were repeated.
# 1 sample was repeated because precipitate was observed in the first culture.
# another sample was repeated because the wrong substance was used in the first culture.

## Set wllq==0 for controls on plates where all treatments were repeated ----

# inspired by investigations/assess_impact_of_hot_water_shutoff_in_building_DNT_NTP2021-2022-07-27.R,
# I realized that there are certain plates for which all treatments were determined to be very noisy and had to be repeated
# or were very potent (and so any potential noise was likely masked by the cytotoxicity).
# Since all of these 'noisy' treatments replicates come from 1 culture date, and wllq == 0 for these treatments already,
# I think we can conclude that this culture was off, and so we don't want to include the control wells from this culture
# in the calculation of dataset-wide values such as the bmad

# Confirm that all treatments determined to be "noisy" are coming from the same culture
