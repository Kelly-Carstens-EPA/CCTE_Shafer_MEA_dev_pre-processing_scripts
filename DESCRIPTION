Description: CCTE_Shafer_MEA_dev_pre-processing_scripts transforms experimental data from recordings of electrical activity on micro-electrode array plates to a single, long-format data table that is ready for curve-fitting and hit calling with the R package "tcpl". Data from cytotoxicity experiments done alongside the assay is also integrated.
